Kyphosis is an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine. This project is practical and directly applicable to the healthcare industry.
 
# Classifiers Used
* Logistic Regression CLassifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

# Procedure 
* Initially we import the dataset and study the variables present in it.
* We perform a basic EDA on the data to get an idea about the distribution of the data.
* To start the implementation of the classifiers we scale the data and split it into training and testing set.
* Finally we fit each classifier model to it and check the accuracy of the model.
